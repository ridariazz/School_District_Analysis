# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of this Project 

In this project, we analyzed the data for every school district to provide visual analysis (in this case, Data Frames) for the performance of the students' overall testing performance for math and reading as well as funding for every school mentioned in the dataset. Our school district summary consists of the summzarization of the key metrics:

- Total number of students
- Total number of schools
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage of students who passed math
- Percentage of students who passed reading
- Overall passing percentage

Moreover, we had to perform this analysis twice as officials noticed academic dishonesty for the math and reading scores for Thomas High School to determine if the changes in this report had affected the overall analysis.
